TinyURDF is a fast and lightweight C++17 library for reading and processing URDF model files. It supports complex structures like parallel multibodies and graph-like models, which many other tools do not. Designed to be cross-platform with lightweight external dependencies, it aims to provide a simple and stable API for loading, processing, converting, and validating multi-joint models. It also includes a built-in scripting engine, allowing users to interact with models and convert them to JSON or YAML. The main advantage is that it does not depend on ROS or any existing tools.
